This is a showcase of some assorted hands-on work done by me at
[Filmgate](http://www.filmgate.se).
Besides working on the graphics (and generally running the company with my
co-founders), I was responsible for script breakdowns and on-set supervision
for many feature film productions. A full list of productions can be seen over
at [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1972642/).

Some of the later productions before leaving Filmgate in 2009 is unfortunately
not included in the showreel.
