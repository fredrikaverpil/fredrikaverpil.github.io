While studying at [Hyper Island](http://www.hyperisland.com) all students were assigned to find a company, willing to take us on as interns for 20 weeks. I went for a position at [Method](http://www.method.com) and relocated to New York City for about six months (June - December, 2001).

There I worked with the great team as Design Technolgist, developing a new website for Gucci, mainly working with actionscripting in Macromedia Flash 4 for both front-end (interaction, navigation, animation) and back-end.
