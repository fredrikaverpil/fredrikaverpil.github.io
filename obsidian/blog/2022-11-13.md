This is my journey to manage my personal website in Obsidian, export it into Hugo and publish onto GitHub pages.

## Features (wish list)

- Site structure:
	- Blog entries, managed via Obsidian.
	- Tech notes / cheat-sheets, managed via Obsidian.
	- An "about me"-page, managed via Obsidian.
- Ability to embed gists, but using custom CSS to make them look more integrated.
- Search (might make tags unnecessary).
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting.
- Ability to somehow showcase .ipynb (Jupyter notebooks).
	- Could use .ipynb gists.
	- Could run pyscript to make it interactive.
- GitHub-powered commenting system.
- Use a popular static site generator (markdown) offering a wide range of themes I can select from.
- Use a CLI tool to export from Obsidian to this static site generator's expected format.
- Use GHA to automatically perform the export/convert and publishing onto my personal GitHub pages website.
