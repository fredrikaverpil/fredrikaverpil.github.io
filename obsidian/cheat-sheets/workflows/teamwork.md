# Teamwork
## Specialists vs generalists
> We want everybody to handle everything!

Pros:

-   We always have somebody on hand that can address any issue.
-   Less communication (tickets) needed since one person can drive the back-end

part of a feature from A-Z.Cons:

-   People are usually happier working on things they're good at
-   There will always be cases when expertise is needed that cannot be expected from somebody who is learning a technology.Planning needed:
    1.  Set a scope for what people are expected to be able to do outside their expertise.
    2.  If we're not there yet with regards to the expected knowledge from the previous point, how do we share knowledge to make that a possibility?

> We want people to work where their expertise lies!

Pros:

-   When work is being done it gets done quickly
-   The code standards in each domain can possibly be higher
-   People get to work with what they like to do
-   More natural to most people

Planning needed:

1.  Break down tickets into connected parts that match one expertise?
2.  Other ideas?
