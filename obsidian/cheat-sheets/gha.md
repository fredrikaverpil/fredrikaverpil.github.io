## Single quotes

Never use double quotes inside `${{Â ...Â }` as it is simply not supported.

## Tertiary

GHA has a really funky tertiary: `${{Â xÂ &&Â 'ifTrue'Â ||Â 'ifFalse'Â }}`

This only works ifÂ `<ifTrue>`Â isn't the empty string. IfÂ `<ifTrue>Â ==Â ''`Â thenÂ `''`Â is considered asÂ `false`, which then evaluates the right hand side of theÂ `||`.

There are lots of gotchas here, and this is a great thread highlighting more of it: [Conditional operator or function for expression syntax Â· Issue #409 Â· actions/runner (github.com)](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/409)

Example:

```yaml
steps:
- name: stuff
env:
  PR_NUMBER_OR_MASTER: ${{ github.event.number == 0 && 'master' ||  format('pr-{0}', github.event.number)  }}
```

## Pipx via actions/setup-python

When using [actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) and [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry), you can use [pipx)](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to install Poetry outside of your project's virtual environment. The setup-python action provides pipx by default, but you might notice how it is not running under the Python version you chose.

To fix this, you can pass the `--python` argument to pipx:

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  id: cpython_setup
  with:
    python-version: "3.10"

- run: pipx install <package> --python '${{ steps.cpython_setup.outputs.python-path }}'
```

## Python package caching

When using actions/cache, you can use the `${{ steps.cpython_setup.outputs.python-version }}` as part of the cache key:

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  id: cpython_setup
  with:
    python-version: "3.10"

- uses: actions/cache@v3
  id: python-cache
  env:
    SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MIN: "15"
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/pip
      ~/.cache/pypoetry
    key: pip-poetry-${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-py-${{ steps.cpython_setup.outputs.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles('poetry.lock') }}
```

The cache key can be extended with e.g. Poetry's dependency groups.
