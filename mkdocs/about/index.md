# About me

:wave: Hey there!

I am a passionate, enthusiastic and professional software developer, continuously striving to evolve with Python as the primary language of choice â€” and preferably building scalable and reliable solutions in public cloud environments.

I advocate continuous development, automated testing, "clean code" vs simplicity/perf so to maintain as high code quality as possible. I am deeply invested in the open source community and love collaborating and contributing.

This my personal blog, where I scribble down notes on software development (mostly :material-language-python:), open source, and other stuff I love tinkering with! :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:
