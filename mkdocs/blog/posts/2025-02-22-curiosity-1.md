# Gemini, Go Meetup and new Neovim tools dropped

- I'm fortunate to work at [a company](https://einride.tech) which allows the
  use of AI, and in this case Google Gemini Advanced. It's really, really fast
  but I still feel Claude (Sonnet 3.5) is a lot more accurate as well has better
  taste. But it's still extremely helpful to have this at your disposal. A
  colleague of mine took a third-party API spec and asked Gemini to write the Go
  types for it for him. Awesome!
- This week was the most sunny in Gothenburg since, I don't even know when.
  Toying with the idea to start commuting to work by bike.
- It was so fun and uplifting to be speaking at the latest
  [Go Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sweden-go-west/events/305475640/) here in
  Gothenburg. Let's keep this momentum up!

- [gitingest](https://gitingest.com) - essentially replace the `github.com` in
  repository URLs with `gitingest.com` and download the whole repo as one
  structured text file that you can upload to AI chat of your choice. If the
  text file becomes to large for [Claude](https://claude.ai) Sonnet 3.5 (my
  favorite pair-programming LLM), try [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/),
  which has support for a larger context window.
- [`lazydocker`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) - I Use `lazygit`
  extensively and I recently saw there's also this project with a very similar
  UI that you can use to manage your containers. I have been using Podman's GUI
  dashboard as it gives a great overview of containers, images, volumes etc, but
  I appreciate not having to leave the terminal. And with lazydocker, you get
  even better overview IMHO.
- [`git-remove-branches`](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/dotfiles/blob/main/shell/bin/git-remove-branches) -
  a shell script I wrote to finally get control of all stale local (and remote)
  branches. Put it on `$PATH` and run!
- [pr.nvim](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/pr.nvim) - I was missing the
  capability to quickly get to the pull request associated with the line under
  the cursor. So I wrote this tool!
- [godoc.nvim](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/godoc.nvim) - I wrote a small
  tool for reading Go documentation from within Neovim.
- [snacks.nvim's image](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/image.md) -
  Folke is at it again, and as part of his endevour to serve us the buffet that
  is `snacks.nvim`, you can now enable the "image" feature, which will show
  images in Neovim. I use it to show images from markdown files primarily. It's
  absolutely awesome. Note that it requires a terminal with support for the
  kitty graphics protocol. I had to also make sure to have ImageMagick
  installed.
