# A treasure trove of learning Python videos

Here's a fantastic resource for anyone who wish they could learn from a Python
professional rather than reading a book: [Corey Schafer's Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU)

Among Cory's [other playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists)
there are playlists covering how to [set up a Python developer environment](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt66h8cVpmbayBKlMTuS55y),
[object oriented programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc) and [general programming terms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsnP0Nl1UDY8VZAlHu1m_MQ) which also apply to Python.

All in all, a fantastic starting point for anyone wanting to get into Python as well as wrapping your head around certain concepts which take you from beginner to intermediate Python developer.
