# Native per-project tools in Go 1.24

There are
[some exciting news](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48429#issuecomment-2499281711)
in the Go community as of recently on how to manage tools in Go projects. With
the next release of Go ([Go 1.24](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.24), expected
to be released in February 2025), it seems we'll finally have a way to natively
define per-project tools! ðŸŽ‰

This hopefully means no more `Makefile` and/or `tools.go` for managing project
tooling. And it looks like e.g. Dependabot will support this out of the box too.

<!-- more -->

## Giving this a spin with `gotip`

You can try it out today using
[`gotip`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip):

```bash
go install golang.org/dl/gotip@latest
gotip download
```

Let's have a look at the docs for `go tool` (in this case, `gotip tool`):

```bash
$ gotip help tool
usage: go tool [-n] command [args...]

Tool runs the go tool command identified by the arguments.

Go ships with a number of builtin tools, and additional tools
may be defined in the go.mod of the current module.

With no arguments it prints the list of known tools.

The -n flag causes tool to print the command that would be
executed but not execute it.

For more about each builtin tool command, see 'go doc cmd/<command>'.
```

Then let's create a project and add some tools to it:

```bash
gotip mod init go-playground
gotip get -tool github.com/alta/protopatch/cmd/protoc-gen-go-patch
gotip get -tool gotest.tools/gotestsum

```

There's a new `tool` section in the `go.mod`!

```gomod
$ cat go.mod
module go-playground

go 1.24

tool (
        github.com/alta/protopatch/cmd/protoc-gen-go-patch
        gotest.tools/gotestsum
)

require (
        github.com/alta/protopatch v0.5.3 // indirect
        github.com/bitfield/gotestdox v0.2.2 // indirect
        github.com/dnephin/pflag v1.0.7 // indirect
        github.com/fatih/color v1.16.0 // indirect
        github.com/fatih/structtag v1.2.0 // indirect
        github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify v1.7.0 // indirect
        github.com/google/shlex v0.0.0-20191202100458-e7afc7fbc510 // indirect
        github.com/mattn/go-colorable v0.1.13 // indirect
        github.com/mattn/go-isatty v0.0.20 // indirect
        golang.org/x/mod v0.16.0 // indirect
        golang.org/x/sync v0.6.0 // indirect
        golang.org/x/sys v0.18.0 // indirect
        golang.org/x/term v0.18.0 // indirect
        golang.org/x/text v0.14.0 // indirect
        golang.org/x/tools v0.19.0 // indirect
        google.golang.org/protobuf v1.31.0 // indirect
        gotest.tools/gotestsum v1.12.0 // indirect
)
```

You can now run tools like this:

```bash
gotip tool <the-tool>
```

And if you step out of the project, the tool you just added is no longer
available.

You can also see which bundled tools are available by default with Go 1.24:

```bash
$ gotip tool

addr2line
asm
buildid
cgo
compile
covdata
cover
dist
distpack
doc
fix
link
nm
objdump
pack
pprof
preprofile
test2json
trace
vet
```

## Summary

I think this development is great. It's something my colleagues and myself have
been waiting for.

This new `go tool` workflow introduces less complexity (than the
`Makefile`/`tools.go` setup) but it likely won't solve all the use cases, like
~~splitting out test dependencies from the production dependencies~~ (see
amendment below) or solve/improve integration with IDEs/editors.

## Amendment, 2024-12-04

It seems like it will be possible to split out dependencies from the main
`go.mod` file:

```bash
gotip mod init -modfile=tool.mod foo
gotip get -modfile=tool.mod -tool gotest.tools/gotestsum
```
