# Claude Coder, Go tool and Dependabot updates

- I _did_ end up dusting off my gravelbike and biked to work twice this week,
  which translates into biking 11 km @ ~30 minutes x2 (roundtrip). It ended up
  taking the same time as commuting by bus/tram and was a great opportunity to
  not only get excercise but to also listen in to some interesting Podcasts.
- I'm so happy about the
  [Razer Kishi Ultra](https://www.razer.com/ap-en/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi-ultra)
  in combination with my [iPad Mini (USB-C)](https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/).
  It's the best hand-held experience when combined with
  [PXPlay](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pxplay-remote-streaming/id1638586503)
  (since it can map the touchbar button). Currently hooked on the somewhat weird
  but fun Persona 5. It's got pretty neat
  [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/4pJT0WKggr4xk149X8A6KC?si=Fo6HN7KYTQ6Yfndw-6ymxw)
  for an RPG too!

- [Hacker News | best](https://news.ycombinator.com/best) - a hidden "best"
  filter, which is for some reason invisible from the navigation unless you
  visit that specific URL. For those of you who want a digest of the most
  upvoted/commented on topics throughout the last couple of days (not sure
  exactly what the algorithm is like).
- [Alex Edwards' post on `go tool`](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/how-to-manage-tool-dependencies-in-go-1.24-plus) -
  now that Go 1.24 is out, this could potentially be the definitive guide to
  `go tool`.
- [Claude Coder](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)
  was released next to the Sonnet 3.7 model. It looks similar to
  [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) but feels more polished. I really
  like these TUI LLM tools as it complements my workflow really well, which is
  centralized around working in the terminal. The big thing Aider has going for
  it is supporting a wide variety of LLMs, including local models.
- Dependabot now supports
  [Docker compose files](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/390)
  and
  [Python `uv.lock` files](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10478)
  (requires enabling the feature flag `enable-beta-ecosystems: true`)
- [All the reasons why Python's `uv` is the better choice](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-year-of-uv-pros-cons-and-should) -
  in case you need help convincing yourself or anyone else.
- [GopherCon YouTube videos](https://gopherconeurope.substack.com/p/release-notes-v20246)
  are up, and the next conference is happening in Berlin, 16-19 July.
- [yutkat's Neovim plugins list for Go development](https://github.com/yutkat/my-neovim-pluginlist/blob/main/go.md)
  contains some interesting workflow enhancers. I already use
  [maxandron/goplements](https://github.com/maxandron/goplements.nvim) but here
  I found
  [edte/blink-go-import.nvim](https://github.com/edte/blink-go-import.nvim)
  which I was unaware of!
- [godoc.nvim](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/godoc.nvim) now has support for
  adapters, which means it could potentially support other languages/things you
  want to use a picker with.
- [dependabot-fix](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/dotfiles/blob/main/shell/bin/dependabot-fix) -
  a shell script I wrote this week which helps looping over all failing
  dependabot PRs in a given repo and apply the command and commit necessary to
  fix it.
- [go-mod-tidy](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/dotfiles/blob/main/shell/bin/go-mod-tidy) -
  a small shell script which recursively runs `go mod tidy` from you current
  working directory. Great for monorepos and nested Go projects.
