# Saturn Relay

![Saturn Relay](/static/saturn/saturn.png)

During one month, summer 2004, I had the opportunity to work with the very talented people at [North Kingdom](http://www.northkingdom.com), Skellefteå, where we produced a campaign website for Saturn’s new family car, The Relay.

My task was to create 3D elements for the website. Most of my work involved modeling, texturing, animation, lighting and rendering as well as compositing.
