# Pistvakt

![](/static/gallery/2005-pistvakt.jpg)

One of my very first feature film visual effects projects, where I primarily performed compositing and blue screen keying in Shake as well as some minor 3D work in Maya while working at Farmland, Trollhättan.

This was, at the time, the largest blue screen production to have been made in Scandinavia.
