title: Cartesian product in Python

A [cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) operation can return a set of "combinations" based on given values, so for example I could have the following values:

a | b | c
- | - | -
1 | 1 | 1
  | 2 | 2
  |   | 3

I would then expect the cartesian product operation to return something like `a1b1c1, a1b1c2, a1b1c3, a1b2c1` and so on...

Many, many times have had to solve this problem over and over in Python... it's time to jot down some notes.

<!--more-->

I'm taking the table above and making it into a dictionary:

```python
d = {'a': [1], 'b': [1, 2], 'c': [1, 2, 3]}
```

This can be fed into the following `cprod` function:

```python
import sys
import itertools

def cprod(dictionary):
    """Generate a list of dicts of cartesian product combinations."""

    if sys.version_info.major > 2:
        return (dict(zip(dictionary, x)) for x in itertools.product(*dictionary.values()))

    return (dict(itertools.izip(dictionary, x))
            for x in itertools.product(*dictionary.itervalues()))
```

...which will return a generator object, which can be looped over (once, before it gets destroyed):

```python
>>> for _dict in cprod(d):
>>>     print(_dict)
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 3}
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Number of combinations are `len(list(cprod(d)))` (in this case 6).

If we wish to get the list of combinations directly, we can use the `cprod_combos` function:

```python
def cprod_combos(dictionary):
    """Generate a list of cartesian product combinations."""
    combos = []
    for _dict in cprod(d):
        combo = ''
        for key, value in _dict.items():
            combo += '%s%s' % (key, value)
        combos.append(combo)
    return combos
```

...which will return a list of combinations:

```python
>>> [i for i in cprod_combos(d)]
['a1b1c1', 'a1b1c2', 'a1b1c3', 'a1b2c1', 'a1b2c2', 'a1b2c3']
```
