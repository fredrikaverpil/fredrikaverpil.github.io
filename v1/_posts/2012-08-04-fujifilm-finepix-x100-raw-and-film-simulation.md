– Why film simulations are not disabled when shooting RAW?

<!--more-->

A RAW file is a photo that hasn’t been developed yet and simply consist of numerical values representing the amount of light that has been recorded by the sensor (in the case of the X100 this is 12-bit per pixel). It has to be somehow converted into RGB in order to be viewable on a computer screen (or the camera’s LCD/EVF) as an image that you can look at. This can be done through RAW converters or image viewers which know how to interpret the RAW file into an RGB image.

So, when you choose e.g. the film simulation “Astia”, this is the film simulation (or RAW converter’s formula to convert into RGB) used in order to present an image to you in the LCD/EVF and when playing back the images you have shot (see “Preview Image in the EXIF” further down below). The camera needs to do this in order to let you know what you are shooting and what you have shot. Otherwise you would just see 12.37 million different numerical values of light, and that wouldn’t help to know if your shot was in focus.

The film simulation is not baked into the RAW file that is recorded to your memory card in any other way than the film simulation’s name (in this case “Astia”). Therefore applications such as Adobe Lightroom will never be able to reproduce Fujifilm’s film simulations automatically upon import of a RAW file, unless they know Fuji’s secret formula for the specific film simulation – and they don’t.

Try changing the film simulation to “Monochrome” and you’ll see that the LCD/EVF turns grayscale. This however does not mean you are recording an grayscale-only image if you are shooting RAW. However, if you are shooting JPG-only, all RAW data is converted to RGB, then the RAW data gets discarded and there will be only a grayscale RGB JPG image. When a RAW file shot with the “Monochrome” film simulation is imported into e.g. Adobe Lightroom or Adobe Photoshop the image will be in color and not in grayscale/monochrome. This is only because ACR supports X100/X-Pro1 RAW files and does a pretty decent job in showing you what it think that the photo should look like with its RGB conversion formula (it’s not Provia, it’s not Astia, it’s … Adobes own film simulation made for the X100, if you will – only difference here being you can go in and tweak that formula with sliders and buttons.

## The in-camera converter

Since you have shot the photo in RAW, you can always launch the built-in RAW-processor software in-camera and change the film simulation into something else and then “develop” the photo into a JPG using other settings than you had when shooting the image. The RAW file, however, will never be altered when doing this and will always remain as RAW data. This also applies to a number of other settings such as the tone of shadow and highlights. All of that can be changed after having shot the RAW photo.

## Advanced control during RAW development

I can recommend that everyone shooting RAW take a look at [RAW Photo Processor](http://www.raw-photo-processor.com/). It’s offering an extremely eccentric control over the RAW development process. It’s completely free but unfortunately I believe it is only available on Mac OS X.
