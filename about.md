Throughout the years I've been spending my professional life within the digital domain of creativity and programming; from web site design/development to 3D animation and digital visual effects for feature films. I've had professional experience within the field of 3D graphics since 2005, including co-founding [Filmgate](http://www.filmgate.se) and developing the computer graphics pipeline at [Industriromantik](http://www.industriromantik.se). Today, I take part in an extraordinary team of talent at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com) in the role of Design Architect. Here, besides development predominantly in Python, I get to work with cloud native technologies such as OpenStack, Docker, Kubernetes and Spinnaker.
