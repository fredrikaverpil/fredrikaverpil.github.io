Throughout the years I have been spending my professional life within the digital domain of creativity; from web site design/development to 3D animation and digital visual effects for feature films. With professional experience within the field of 3D graphics since 2005, including co-founding [Filmgate](http://www.filmgate.se), I now take part in the extraordinary team of talent at [Industriromantik](http://www.industriromantik.se) as lead Python developer, in charge of the application lifecycle management. This is a multi-faceted role which involves a great deal of software architecting, programming and devops.
