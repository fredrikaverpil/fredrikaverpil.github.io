Thorsten Ball has a great blog series called "Joy and Curiosity" over at
[Register Spill](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com) which celebrates the
interesting and joyful parts of the week that passed by. I initially heard about
this on the [Cup o' Go podcast](https://cupogo.dev) and his ideas resonates
incredibly well on how I have come to view life as a software engineer.

I really encourage you to listen in to that Cup o' Go
[episode](https://cupogo.dev/episodes/supply-chain-attacks-ghetto-logs-and-rust-ai-cold-takes-with-thorsten-ball),
where Thorsten speaks his mind, not only on his very based and nuanced view on
AI or Rust vs Go, but also on generally sharing joy and positiveness throughout
this blog series of his.

And in case you're ever reading this, Thorsten, you inspired me to take up
blogging again after years of hiatus ❤️ and please forgive me for blatantly
stealing your reasoning around Joy and Curiosity and its format. It just
resonates so incredibly well with my own thoughts.

Stay tuned for the first part of a continous blog series about what joyful,
interesting things I've experienced or come across during the past week or so.
It'll be primarily focussed around sharing links and insights which I think
others may find valuable.
