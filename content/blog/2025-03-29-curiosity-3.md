Spring is coming, and the sun has been out a lot more. This weekend I’m meeting
up with childhood friends, without the logistics and responsibilities which
normally is part of my daily family life with young kids. I think sometimes
young adults, or just people who doesn’t have kids, would think I’m
exaggerating. I’m a simple man (and it's fine if you call me "old" 😅) but I’m
_really_ looking forward to sipping on some newly brewed coffee outdoors and in
the sun, having adult conversations around - not work, not responsibilities, not
logistics - but what comes into mind, in the moment.

- GitHub Copilot now has
  [a free tier](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot).
  I actually cancelled my subscription and I'm now on the free plan, to see if
  that's sufficient for my usage (which is limited personal projects outside of
  work).
- GitHub has taken
  [fine grained PATs](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-03-18-fine-grained-pats-are-now-generally-available)
  to GA. This is nice, as some settings had to be manually changed in the GitHub
  repo's settings but can now be set in the token instead. Useful when you think
  of permissions around GitHub Actions workflows, for example.
- It looks like GitHub finally addressed Dependabot's inability to upgrade
  dependencies in the pyproject.toml's `[dependency-groups]` section, as part of
  [dependabot-core#1084](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10847#event-16730889459).
- I realized the other day that Go tooling added to the `go.mod` via
  `go get -tool <pkgname>` will not be considered for updating by Dependabot
  unless you specify the `allow` and `dependency-name` fields, as they are
  stored as _indirect_ dependencies, which Dependabot apparently does not update
  by default. See
  [the Dependdabot yml docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference#allow--)
  for more details.
- [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/)
  was released and it works great when I use it with MCP servers in
  [Codecompanion.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim) and with
  [mcphub.nvim](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcphub.nvim) (which has a big
  [refactoring effort](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcphub.nvim/pull/40) going
  on ahead of its 4.0.0 release, which they are asking for feedback on). I
  haven't fully concluded whether Gemini 2.5 Pro works better for me than Claude
  Sonnet 3.7 or not, but it is cheaper and faster. I have a feeling Google, like
  the train it is, is getting its momentum up here...
- I took [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) for a test drive and
  installed some local MCP servers. It's pretty useful when you want to leverage
  its ability to render HTML/frontend/interactive stuff, as such things are more
  difficult to preview in the editor.
  [This official guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) was
  very helpful in getting set up, and it also contains details on how to
  [build a simple MCP server yourself](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).
- I wrote a new tool, [multipr](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/multipr), for
  making the same change (or set of changes) to multiple GitHub repositories.
  I've been thinking of making such a tool many, many times...
- Neovim v0.11.0 is out and Gregory put out a
  [great blog post with highlights](https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-11/).
  With this new release, setup LSPs will be a lot easier. However, before
  migrating off `lsp-config` completely, keep an eye out on
  [this PR](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3659) which refactors
  the configs for this new way of defining the LSP configs. My thought is that
  it could still be nice with some sane defaults being provided by `lsp-config`.
