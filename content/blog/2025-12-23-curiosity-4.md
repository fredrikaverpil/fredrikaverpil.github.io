Inbetween eggnog and christmas carols, I figured I need to bring a short update
about things that have been on my mind "lately".

## LLMs

[Gemini 3 Pro Preview](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/) was released,
but I prefer [Claude Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5)
in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) over Gemini for
anything coding related. I've also started to rely more and more on skills,
which I heard
[OpenAI is adopting too](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/).
But for everything else, it's Gemini 3 all the way. I wonder if
[Gemini 3 Flash](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/) will beat Claude
in coding tasks (it kind of
[sounds like some people are very impressed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301851))?

I also helped set up LLM access via
[Vertex AI in Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). This means
using Claude and Gemini models, professionally! 🤠 I even hacked Claude into
performing formal GitHub pull request reviews with suggestions and everything.
Sometimes very nice, but sometimes a bit noisy.

Speaking of juggling all these CLIs; Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI (and
OpenCode, which I don't really use much anymore)... The
[sidekick.nvim](https://github.com/folke/sidekick.nvim) is my go-to way to
interact and switch between them. I can highly recommend it before any
[ACP-integrated](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction) Neovim
plugin.

A big one for me personally this autumn was to finally get streaming results
implemented into
[neotest-golang](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/neotest-golang) and get
v2.0.0 out the door.

[nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) finally
switched officially over onto its `main` branch, which puts the debate to rest
whether to depend on the legacy `master` branch or the new one.

For [godoc.nvim](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/godoc.nvim) I implemented a
tree-sitter parser which identifies `go doc` parts that I want
syntax-highlighted as Go code. Check it out, it's pretty neat!

From my personal stash of UX improvement scripts, I bring you Go symbols
searching across all files in the current package, with
[this custom snacks.nvim picker](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/dotfiles/commit/407542a502433959c85fea61d80d74b945b08104)
(check out the main branch for any touchups).

Then I noticed Anton Zhiyanov has a new
[Accepted! blog series](https://antonz.org/tags/accepted/), which talks in depth
around accepted Go proposals which have yet to hit the language. Super nice with
all these code examples. If you rather want to track this yourself, subscribe to
[this never-ending GitHub issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33502).

Turns out [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is
[in maintenance mode](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/releases/tag/9.7.0)
🤯. I didn't see this one coming. They made all of their insiders features free
and available, which is nice. But all their efforts are now going into
[Zensical](https://zensical.org), which will be their next-generation static
site generator. This move actually pushed me over the edge to finally move away
from Python and host my own blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), here at
GitHub Pages.

I caved and got a
[PS Portal](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player/)
when I heard you could stream most of your library (requires subscription). This
is really awesome and the experience is much better than when streaming from
your console. Plus that now the kids can use the console and I can use the
Portal. 😄 I'm currently deep in
[Kingdom Come: Deliverance II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Come:_Deliverance_II).

And with that, happy holidays! 🎄⛄
