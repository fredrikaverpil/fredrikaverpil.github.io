I'm a passionate, enthusiastic and professional software developer with 15+
years of professional software engineering experience. I'm part of a
backend-focused team, developing our Google Cloud-hosted and event-based SaaS
platform using technologies such as Go, Protobuf, gRPC, Pub/Sub, Spanner,
Postgres and Terraform.

This is my personal blog, where I scribble down notes on software development,
open source, and other stuff I love tinkering with! 🥰
